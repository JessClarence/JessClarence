# 📘 MIS 001 ROAD MAP: Starter Edition  

> *"The hardest thing you can do is open the door."*  

---

## 📌 Introduction  

**MIS 001** is my very first step into the **Master’s in Information Systems** program.  
The introduction was truly engaging—I learned not just about the course itself, but also how **Information Systems (IS)**, **Information Technology (IT)**, and **Computer Science (CS)** differ from each other.  

I began to see how essential IS is in the real world—**bridging the gap between business needs and technology solutions**.

## 🛠 Why Did I Enroll to MIS  

I was drawn to this course because it promised a balance—half business, half IT. That's true-
but after taking the MIS 001 subject, I realized it’s **so much more**.  

MIS combines:  
- 🧠 **Theoretical concepts** that build understanding  
- 🛠 **Practical applications** that turn concepts into real solutions  

This balance lets me **visualize how theory transforms into action** in real-world situations.

## 🎯 My Objectives  

### 1️⃣ Build My Thesis into Reality  
My ultimate goal is to develop a **fintech micro-financing platform**  
where people can take loans **without collateral**.  
This course is part of the foundation for making that happen.  

### 2️⃣ Merge My Passions  
I’ve always loved **business strategy** 💼 and **technology** 💻. MIS is the perfect intersection.  

### 3️⃣ Learn Beyond Self-Study  
Why not MIT?  
> MIT topics can often be learned through “YouTube University.”  
> MIS, however, gives me what self-study can’t: **structured guidance, real-world cases, and mentorship from experts**.

## 🚀 Looking Forward

If this is only the *starter edition*, I can’t wait to unlock the **full version**.
